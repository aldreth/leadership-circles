    <h1 class="mb-2xl">The Leadership Circle Programme</h1>
    <p>
      <em>Enabling you to deepen your leadership presence, impact and practice.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      The Leadership Circle Programme is a different form of leadership development; it uses the
      context of the woods, campfire and circle to support leaders connect to what it means to be
      human and a leader at this point in time.
    </p>
    <p>
      The programme is in the form of six day sessions running fortnightly over 3 months, for a group
      of 10. The sessions run sequentially and allow for a gradual development of elements that
      support a deeper practice of leadership required for our times. This format also allows for an
      intensity of focus and momentum to develop. Participants are asked to commit to all dates
      before they sign up.
    </p>
    <p>
      The programme is very intentionally designed to take place around a campfire in woods; using
      the teaching that nature and woods have to offer as a key part of the programme design. Equally
      key to our approach is the use of circling as a learning structure, supporting you to tap into your
      own deeply held insight and wisdom, as well as sharing that of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      We start with where you are now in your practice, and what it is like being a leader as a human at
      this point in time. We invite you to explore the current challenges, with the intention of
      developing a fuller understanding. We then connect to the future and your unique contribution.
      Practices that can support leadership of the future are developed along the way.

## Who is the Leadership Circle Programme for?

The Leadership Circle Programme is intended for those leaders who want to deeply explore their unique contribution to the world through their practice of leadership, wherever this takes place.

Leadership Circles allow those who have been doing leadership for some time but want to deepen their practice or want to lead in a different way, to have the space to tap into their own insight and wisdom, in a supportive environment. It is an invitation for you to work in relationship with yourself, others and the wider world; to perceive things differently and have a sense of what to do and how to be, for you in your context.

## What you’ll take away:

- a better understanding of where you are now, the challenges you face, and who/how
  you want to be as a leader into the future
- greater clarity about your unique contribution
- practices that will support you as a leader
- skills in reflection, dialogue and observation
- increased ability to tap into your own insight
- something completely unique to you and your leadership practice
