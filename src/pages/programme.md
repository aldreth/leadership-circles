    <h1>Design of the programme</h1>
    <p>
      The programme is very intentionally designed to take place around a campfire in woods; using
      the teaching that nature and woods have to offer as a key part of the programme design. Equally
      key to our approach is the use of circling as a learning structure, supporting you to tap into your
      own deeply held insight and wisdom, as well as sharing that of others.
    </p>
    <p>
      We start with where you are now in your practice, and what it is like being a leader as a human at
      this point in time. We invite you to explore the current challenges, with the intention of
      developing a fuller understanding. We then connect to the future and your unique contribution.
      Practices that can support leadership of the future are developed along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      The programme is in the form of six day sessions running fortnightly over 3 months, for a group
      of 10. The sessions run sequentially and allow for a gradual development of elements that
      support a deeper practice of leadership required for our times. This format also allows for an
      intensity of focus and momentum to develop. Participants are asked to commit to all dates
      before they sign up.

## Who is the Leadership Circles Programme for?

The Leadership Circle Programme is intended for those leaders who want to deeply explore their
unique contribution to the world through their practice of leadership, wherever this takes place.

Leadership Circles allow those who have been doing leadership for some time but want to
deepen their practice or want to lead in a different way, to have the space to tap into their own
insight and wisdom, in a supportive environment. It is an invitation for you to work in
relationship with yourself, others and the wider world; to perceive things differently and have a
sense of what to do and how to be, for you in your context.

## What you’ll take away:

- a better understanding of where you are now, the challenges you face, and who/how
  you want to be as a leader into the future
- greater clarity about your unique contribution
- practices that will support you as a leader
- skills in reflection, dialogue and observation
- increased ability to tap into your own insight
- something completely unique to you and your leadership practice

The Leadership Circles are designed in a group of 6 sessions, similar to a leadership programme, allowing for the group to bond and to deepen the learning collectively.

Each session will start with a short grounding practice allowing us to collectively arrive together in the space. We will offer, for the purpose of reflection, a piece from global thought leaders, a poem or some sort of provocation that relates the focus of the session. We may also offer a practical reflection tool for use outside the circle. The majority of the session will be sitting as a circle responding to whatever is emerging, followed by individual reflection.

The six sessions are two and a half hours long, each with a key focus contributing to leadership practice. They run fortnightly over 3 months, taking place in woods near Stamford Bridge, York.

## The sessions

The six sessions run sequentially and allow for a gradual development of elements that support a deeper practice of leadership required for our times.

We start with where you are now, what is it like being a leader as a human being at this point in time. We then explore foundational practices relating to embodied presence followed by how we make sense of your worlds. We look at the impact of separation and connection in the organisational environment and your relationship to complexity, ambiguity and paradox. We end the Circles focusing on the meaning of your work and your version of leadership.
