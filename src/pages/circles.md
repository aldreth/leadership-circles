    <h1>Leadership Circles</h1>
    <p>
      <em>Transform your leadership practice through having a regular reflective space.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Leadership Circles take place monthly allowing leaders to have a regular opportunity to
      process their experiences of the last month and reflect on their leadership practice.
      Circles are a unique and deeply experiential approach, creating spacious communication,
      based in deep listening, respect and authenticity. Circles allow us to slow down and listen to
      what needs to emerge, in ourselves and others.
    </p>
    <p>
      These conditions create safety, allowing innate wisdom, collective intelligence and
      transformation to emerge; the impact of which is felt, not only in the circle, but in our wider
      experience of life and work.
    </p>
    <p>
      Circling is experiential, it is a practice of coming together with others, listening deeply and
      being heard deeply. The practice invites you to pay attention to your own experience in the
      moment as well as to each other, supporting each other with your presence. Through this
      process you will experience a deeper sense of connection to yourself, others and the wider
      world. It will allow you to see things with a new perspective, gain clarity as well as allow
      insights to emerge; it creates a pathway to transformational authentic leadership.
