    <h2>Today’s Leadership Challenge</h2>
    <p>
    The leadership being demanded of today is different than that of the past.  We are needed to work competently with multiple time frames, within the contexts of intersecting global challenges, and rapidly shifting world views and expectations of staff.  More people want their work to provide a sense of purpose and meaning beyond providing for their families; seeking a sense of contribution.  Leadership is being asked to provide ‘transformation’, and quickly.  But this will only be possible through developing different ways of thinking and acting, expanding perceptions and developing new paradigms.
    </p>
    <p>
    There are no easy answers, but one thing is for sure, it will require deeper capabilities in the art and skills of observation, reflection and learning.

## Leadership development

Given this context, what sort of leadership development is needed?

We would argue there is a need for one that is less about being taught ‘stuff’ and more about learning to tap to your innate knowing as a human being. One that supports you to understand more about your own experience of the world, and what this is telling you. We believe Leadership Circling is a powerful methodology that can provide this.

## Leadership Circles

The circle symbolises wholeness and continuity, it also represents the cyclical nature of all things. In a circle there is no hierarchy, all are equal, making it the perfect setting for something very real and important to take place.

Circling is experiential, it is a practice of coming together with others, listening deeply and being heard deeply. The practice invites you to pay attention to your own experience in the moment as well as to each other, supporting each other with your presence. Through this process you will experience a deeper sense of connection to yourself, others and the wider world. It will allow you to see things with a new perspective, gain clarity as well as allow insights to emerge.

    <h2>The woods and the campfire</h2>
    <p>
      Nature is not separate from us, we are nature. However, in the modern world, we have disconnected from our internal and external nature. We live in a time of advancing technology; this way of life has advantages, but the cost has been a disconnection from our innate knowledge of our place within the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming back to nature means coming back to ourselves also. By slowing down and being with nature we open our curiosity, creativity and are able to engage more actively in problem solving and collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting in circle around the campfire has taken place for hundreds of thousands of years. Traditionally the campfire circle was a space for storytelling, social bonding and decision making. When we sit in circle today, we are connecting to a forgotten part of ourselves. We are able to feel a deeper connection with each other, taking us out of our heads, allowing us to experience our whole selves as human beings; living in this place, at this point in time, supporting us to tap into our own insights and wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      We therefore very intentionally hold our leadership circles outside in woods near York.  This both allows us to directly experience our wider context whilst we are learning, and we also use the metaphor of the woods, ecosystems and nature to support the leadership development.

## Who are Leadership Circles for and their purpose?

Leadership Circles allow those who have been doing leadership for some time but want to deepen their practice, to have the space to tap into their own insight and wisdom, in a supportive environment. It is not about being ‘taught’ a theory or a model. It is an invitation for you to work in relationship with yourself, others and the wider world; to perceive things differently and have a sense of what to do and how to be, for you in your context.

## Format of sessions/What’s involved

The Leadership Circles are designed in a group of 6 sessions, similar to a leadership programme, allowing for the group to bond and to deepen the learning collectively.

Each session will start with a short grounding practice allowing us to collectively arrive together in the space. We will offer, for the purpose of reflection, a piece from global thought leaders, a poem or some sort of provocation that relates the focus of the session. We may also offer a practical reflection tool for use outside the circle. The majority of the session will be sitting as a circle responding to whatever is emerging, followed by individual reflection.

The six sessions are two and a half hours long, each with a key focus contributing to leadership practice. They run fortnightly over 3 months, taking place in woods near Stamford Bridge, York.

## The sessions

The six sessions run sequentially and allow for a gradual development of elements that support a deeper practice of leadership required for our times.

We start with where you are now, what is it like being a leader as a human being at this point in time. We then explore foundational practices relating to embodied presence followed by how we make sense of your worlds. We look at the impact of separation and connection in the organisational environment and your relationship to complexity, ambiguity and paradox. We end the Circles focusing on the meaning of your work and your version of leadership.
