    <h1>Today’s Leadership Challenge</h1>
    <p>
      The leadership being demanded of today is different than that of the past. We are needed to
      work within the contexts of intersecting global challenges, shifting societies, responding at
      pace. More people want their work to provide a sense meaning beyond providing for their
      families; seeking a sense of contribution. Leadership is being asked to provide ‘transformation’,
      and quickly. But this will only be possible through expanding perceptions and developing
      different ways of thinking and acting.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are no easy answers, but one thing is for sure, it will require deeper capabilities in the art
      and skills of observation, reflection and learning.

## Leadership development

Given this context, what sort of leadership development is needed?

We would argue that leadership development needs to be more about learning to tap into your innate knowing as a human being. One that supports you to understand more about your own experience of the world, and what this is telling you. We believe Leadership Circling is a powerful methodology that can provide this.

    <h2>The woods and the campfire</h2>
    <p>
      Nature is not separate from us, we are nature. However, in the modern world, we have
      disconnected from our internal and external nature. We live in a time of advancing technology;
      this way of life has advantages, but the cost has been a disconnection from our innate
      knowledge of our place within the whole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Coming back to nature means coming back to ourselves also. By slowing down and being with
      nature we open our curiosity, creativity and are able to engage more actively in problem solving
      and collaboration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sitting in circle around the campfire has taken place for hundreds of thousands of years.
      Traditionally the campfire circle was a space for storytelling, social bonding and decision
      making. When we sit in circle today, we are connecting to a forgotten part of ourselves. We are
      able to feel a deeper connection with each other, taking us out of our heads, allowing us to
      experience our whole selves as human beings; living in this place, at this point in time,
      supporting us to tap into our own insights and wisdom.
    </p>
    <p>
      We therefore very intentionally hold our Leadership Circles and Leadership Circle programme outside
      in woods near York. This both allows us to directly experience our wider context whilst we are
      learning, and we also use the metaphor of the woods, ecosystems and nature to support the development
      of leadership practice.
