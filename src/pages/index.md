headerTitle: 'Today’s Leadership Challenge'
headerText: 'The leadership being demanded of today is different than that of the past. We are needed to work competently with multiple time frames, within the contexts of intersecting global challenges, and rapidly shifting world views and expectations of staff. More people want their work to provide a sense of purpose and meaning beyond providing for their families; seeking a sense of contribution. Leadership is being asked to provide ‘transformation’, and quickly. But this will only be possible through developing new ways of thinking and acting, expanding perceptions and developing new paradigms. How do leaders manage to keep the wheels turning while performing this feat? There are no easy answers, but one thing is for sure, it will require deeper capabilities in the art and skills of observation, reflection and learning.'

    <h2>Leadership development</h2>

        Given this context, what sort of leadership development is needed?
        We would argue there is a need for one that is less about being taught ‘stuff’ and more about learning to tap to your innate knowing as a human being. And one that supports you to understand more about your own experience of the world, and what this is telling you. We believe Leadership Circling is a powerful methodology that can provide this.

## Leadership Circles

Circling is a practice of coming together with others, listening deeply and being heard deeply. The practice invites you to pay attention to your own experience in the moment as well as to each other, supporting each other with your presence. Through this process you will find yourself connecting you yourself, others and the wider world to a greater degree that we are used to in ordinary life, allowing you to see things more clearly and insights to emerge/ reveal themselves to you.

    <h2>The woods and the campfire</h2>
      <p>
        Nature is not separate from us, we are part of it. Something that modern society doesn’t teach us. Nature provides us an opportunity to slowdown, tune in and connect to ourselves, others and everything around us. It supports a cultivation of curiosity, so we can see things with fresh eyes, broadening our perspectives. Sitting around a campfire is something human beings have done for hundreds of thousands of years, it also supports us to access a different part of ourselves. Sitting in nature around a campfire allows us to get out of our heads and in to our whole selves as human beings; living in this place, at this point in time, supporting us to tap into our own insights and wisdom.

        We therefore very intentionally hold our leadership circles outside in woods near York. This both allows us to directly experience our wider context whilst we are learning, and we using the metaphor of the woods, ecosystems and nature to support the leadership development.

## Format of sessions

The Leadership Circles are designed in a group of 6 sessions, similar to a leadership programme, allowing for the group to bond and to deepen the learning collectively. Each session starts with a short meditation to collectively arrive in the space, there will be some for of offering from global thought leaders for the purposes of reflective stimulation and a learning of a key reflective practice. However the majority of the session will be sitting as a circle responding to whatever is emerging. The six sessions are two and a half hours long and run fortnightly over 3 months, taking place in woods near Stamford Bridge, York.
