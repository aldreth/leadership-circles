## Why choose a Leadership Circle Programme?

- The Leadership Circle Programme provides a different experience to a normal class-based programme, with a focus on developing practices and insight; using nature, the campfire and the circle to support learning.
- It is specifically intended to respond this unique point of time, that is requiring a different form of leadership.
- It is acknowledging we can’t just do as we have always done.
- And who doesn’t like being in nature around a campfire?!

## Who is a good fit?

- Those leaders who really want to lead in a different way.
- Leaders who are interested in doing the work on themselves.
- It will particularly suit leaders who have been practicing for some time but want to really challenge their practice in service of others.

## What are the requirements from me?

- We ask you to commit to attending all sessions, appreciating that emergencies can crop up.
- To have an openness of mind and heart, to the process and your fellow travellers.

## What’s the thinking behind the methodology?

- We use **Circling**. Circling is a practice of coming together with others, listening deeply and being heard deeply. Through this process you will experience a deeper sense of connection to yourself, others and the wider world. We use this structure as a key element because it allows you to see things with a new perspective, gain clarity as well as allows insights to emerge.
- We sit around a **campfire**. This has taken place for hundreds of thousands of years. By doing this , we are connecting to a forgotten part of ourselves. We are able to feel a deeper connection with each other, taking us out of our heads, allowing us to experience our whole selves as human beings; living in this place, at this point in time, supporting us to tap into our own insights and wisdom.
- It is **experiential**, this is because our knowledge and understanding is inherently embodied. We make sense of the world through our experience.
- It is **collective**. Leadership is not possible without relationships, it is the interaction with others through which our leadership is experienced. This also allows us to tap into and generate collective intelligence.
- It is in **nature**. We use the woods as our context and our teacher.
